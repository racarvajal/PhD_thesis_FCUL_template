The text of this chapter is shown as written. Additionally, it is possible to include glossary entries, such as \gls{nasa}. The definitions for such entries must be included in the file \texttt{glossaries.tex} following the instructions from the packages \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/glossaries}{\texttt{glossaries}} and \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries-extra}{\texttt{glossaries-extra}}. The first time they are used, the full description is included. For additional uses, only the acronym is shown, as in \gls{nasa}.

It is also possible to use symbols in the same way. For instance, to include something as \gls{hubble_constant}. Then, these symbols and acronyms will be shown in the preambles.

References can also be used in the document. In-text names can be added, such as \textcite{MartinThrones}. It is also possible to show them in parentheses \parencite[such as:][]{whitman1855leaves}. Here, the commands \texttt{parencite} and \texttt{textcite} are preferred since they are more powerful than the older \texttt{citet} and \texttt{citep}.

An example figure is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure_01}. The size it will have when displayed can be selected.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption[First example image]{First example image in this document. There are several ways in which a figure can be added.}
    \label{fig:example_figure_01}
\end{figure}

Including more than one image per figure is also possible thanks to the package \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/subcaption}{\texttt{subcaption}}. Figure~\ref{fig:example_subfigure} shows and example of its implementation, where Figs.~\ref{fig:first_subfigure} and \ref{fig:second_subfigure} can be referenced individually.

        \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{example-image}

    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.40\textwidth}

        \caption{Second subfigure}
        \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{example-image}
        \label{fig:second_subfigure}
    \end{subfigure}

As expected more sections can be added in one chapter. In it, it is possible to include, for instance, a table. The preferred way to do it is through the packages \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/threeparttable}{\texttt{threeparttable}} and \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/threeparttablex}{\texttt{threeparttablex}}. They allow, for instance, including footnotes directly below the table. Also, the package \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}{\texttt{booktabs}} creates the commands \texttt{toprule}, \texttt{midrule}, \texttt{bottomrule}, and \texttt{cmidrule}. Additionally, the use of the package \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx}{\texttt{siunitx}} makes easier to align quantities in different columns. An example is shown in Table~\ref{table:example_table_a}.

    Row B           & 46.80         & 28.22         &  9.59         & 33.44     \\
    Row C           & 24.63         &  7.76         & 28.80         &  0.32     \\
    Row D\tnote{b}  &  9.73         & 51.02         & 38.72         & 38.37     \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \begin{tablenotes}
        \item [a] Footnote for the first column of the table.
        \item [b] Footnote for a particular row.
    \end{tablenotes}
    \end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

As expected, mathematical expressions can also be included in this document.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:example_equation}
    \sin^2(a)+\cos^2(a) = 1\,,
\end{equation}

\noindent where each element of Eq.\ref{eq:example_equation} can be defined. Also, matrices can be included, such as the following.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:example_matrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      (1 - p)^{2} & p (1 - p)\\
      (1 - p) p   & p^{2}
    \end{pmatrix}\,.
\end{equation}

Another relevant feature is the use, as mentioned earlier, of the package \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx}{\texttt{siunitx}}. Adding the needed parameters in the preamble, it is possible to create new units and quantities that can be used. For instance, masses can be expressed as $\mathrm{M}_{\sun} \sim \qty{2e30}{\kg}$ and then use new units as $M_{a} = \qty{1e6}{\msun}$. Checking the file \texttt{mythesis.cls} additional units (and their definitions) can be found (e.g. $\unit{\milli\jansky}$, $\unit{\deg^{2}}$, $\unit{\angstrom}$). In the same way, it is also possible to include angular distances, such as $\ang[angle-symbol-over-decimal]{2;23;15.1}$, and celestial coordinates: right ascension $\ang[angle-symbol-degree=h, angle-symbol-minute=m, angle-symbol-second=s]{12;12;00}$ and declination $\ang{-20;00;00}$.
